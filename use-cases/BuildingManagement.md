# Building Management

**Contributed by:** hylkevds - Fraunhofer IOSB

## Typical user scenario:

A campus of a large organisation has multiple buildings.
The campus has sensors measuring all sorts of observed properties in rooms, hallways and elevators, on doors and windows.
To enable complex querying it would be best to have the relations between those Things/Locations fully exposed in the data model.

An example domain data model:

### Option 1

Squeeze everything into things. Makes linking between different items difficult

### Option 2

Expose the model, mirroring each entity as a Thing:

### Option 3

Replace Things with entities from the model:

### Option 4

Replace Things and Locations with entities from the model:
