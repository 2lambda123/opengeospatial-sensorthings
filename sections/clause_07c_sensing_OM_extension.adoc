A Deployment is the association of Sensors to the Thing that hosts them and produces Datastreams from the associated Sensors. The Deployment entity is optional and the standard does not mandate defining the entity when modelling sensing applications.

If a sensor is redeployed on to the same Host again and the same Datastream needs to be reused, the same Deployment entity SHALL be reused
| `Datastream`                | Datastreams                            | One optional to many optional    | The Deployment entity MAY be used to indicate the current state of the zero-to-many Datastreams, whether it is still open or the deploymentTime has expired
| `Thing`                     | Host                                   | Many optional to one mandatory   | Each Deployment MUST be associated with one and only one Thing. The Thing has the role of the Host as it hosts the associated Sensors

*Deployment Examples*

- The assignment of an array of Sensors onto a platform within a Thing that monitors speed limit and driver distraction on a freeway
- The information pertaining to the orientation of moving Sensors when observing moving Features can be described by a Deployment
