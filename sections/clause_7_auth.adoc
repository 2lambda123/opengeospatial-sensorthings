== STAplus Authentication Requirements


=== Overview
To regulate access to entities using CRUD operations, implementations may wish to use information from user / client application authentication to make access control decisions. 

In addition, some implementations may wish to link the authentication identifier (e.g. `REMOTE_USER`) with the `Party.authId`. Therefore, the STAplus authentiction must provide deployment-wide unique user identifiers.
