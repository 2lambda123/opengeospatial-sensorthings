== Media Types for FeatureOfInterest and Location Encoding

This Standard offers support for different structuring of the `FeatureOfInterest` and `Location` entities. To indicate the support for a particular structure, an implementation can use one of the following media-types:

* `application/geo+json` 
* `application/vnd.ogc.fg+json` footnote:[Informative until <<FG>> is an adopted OGC Standard.]
* `application/wkt` footnote:[Pending approval by IANA.]
