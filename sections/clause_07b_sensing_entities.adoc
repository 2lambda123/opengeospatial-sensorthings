=== The SensorThings API (2.0) Sensing Entities  

All data model requirements classes are grouped in the following requirements class:


[%metadata]
identifier:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing
obligation:: requirement

subject:: Target Type: Data Model
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/thing
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/location
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/historical-location
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/datastream
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/sensor
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/observed-property
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/observation
requirement:: {identifier}/req-class/datamodel/sensing/feature

The OGC SensorThings API (2.0) standard depicts the CORE Sensing entities in Figure 1

![alt text](https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings/blob/23-019_HK/images/GRP0001.png "STA Core").  
*Figure 1*

In this section, we define each entity depicted in Figure 1 and its relationships with other entities. Additionally, we also provide examples to model the entities in different contexts.

The OGC SensorThings API follows the ITU-T definition, i.e., with regard to the Internet of Things, a thing is an object of the physical world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things) that is capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks [ITU-T Y.2060].
[requirement]

Each Thing entity SHALL have the mandatory properties and MAY have the optional properties listed in Table XX.

[requirement]
