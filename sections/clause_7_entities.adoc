== STAplus Entity Types Requirements

`Party`, `License`, `Group`, `Relation` and `Project` are the entity types for STAplus. The implemented entities SHALL be listed in the response to a GET request to the root URL as described in Sensing part. 

An implementation can implement just a single STAplus entity or multiple STAplus entities as required by the use case: Assuming a STAplus service wants to define licensing conditions for observations, then the `License` entity would be implemented. In case that a STAplus service would not only support anonymous read access but also like to support multiple user interactions with full CRUD support, the implementation of `Party` and appropriate business logic is recommended.

The STAplus entities are depicted in <<fig-staplus-datastream-entities>> and <<fig-staplus-multidatastream-entities>>.

In this section, the properties for each entity type and the direct relation to the other entity types are explained. [red]#In addition, for each entity type we show an example of the associated JSON encoding.#


[[party]]
=== Party

This entity can be used to represent acting users and to model ownership. One example for ownership is that a satellite `Thing` is owned by a space agency. This ownership may entitle the space agency to be the only party that can update the thing's location. Other parties can then mount their sensor on the statellite and provide `Datastream` or `MultiDatastream` instances to upload observations. Via the association to the `Datastream` resp. `MultiDatastream` their ownership of the observations is guaranteed. By associating a licence to the (multi)datastream, they could also define re-use conditions.
