== STAplus Entity Type Requirements

`Party`, `License`, `Group`, `Relation` and `Project` are the entity types for STAplus. The implemented entities SHALL be listed in the response to a GET request to the root URL as described in Sensing part. 

An implementation SHALL implement all STAplus entities (with read access) as defined in the Core conformance class.

The STAplus entities are depicted in <<fig-staplus-datastream-entities>> and <<fig-staplus-multidatastream-entities>>.

In this section, the properties for each entity type and the direct relation to the other entity types are explained.

|===


**In SensorThings control information is represented as annotations whose names start with iot followed by a dot ( . ). Annotations are name/value pairs that have a dot ( . ) as part of the name.**

When annotating a name/value pair for which the value is represented as a JSON object, each annotation is placed within the object and represented as a single name/value pair. In SensorThings the name always starts with the “at” sign (@), followed by the namespace iot, followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the term (e.g., **"@iot.id":**1).

When annotating a name/value pair for which the value is represented as a JSON array or primitive value, each annotation that applies to this name/value pair is placed next to the annotated name/value pair and represented as a single name/value pair. The name is the same as the name of the name/value pair being annotated, followed by the “at” sign (**@**), followed by the namespace iot, followed by a dot (.), followed by the name of the term.  (e.g., `+"Locations@iot.navigationLink":"http://example.org/v1.1/Things(1)/Locations"+`)

[[party]]
=== Party

This entity can be used to represent acting users and to model ownership. One example for ownership is that a satellite `Thing` is owned by a space agency. This ownership may entitle the space agency to be the only party that can update the thing's location. Other parties can then mount their sensor on the statellite and provide `Datastream` or `MultiDatastream` instances to upload observations. Via the association to the `Datastream` resp. `MultiDatastream` their ownership of the observations is guaranteed. By associating a licence to the (multi)datastream, they could also define re-use conditions.
