The OGC SensorThings API provides an open standard-based and geospatial-enabled framework to interconnect the Internet of Things devices, data, and applications over the Web.
The Tasking part provides a standard way for parameterizing - also called tasking - of task-able IoT devices, such as individual sensors and actuators, composite consumer / commercial / industrial / smart cities in-situ platforms, mobile and wearable devices, or even unmanned systems platforms such as drones, satellites, connected and autonomous vehicles, etc.
This document is the core of the SensorThings Tasking part. This document follows the CRUD functions, semantics and also query options from OGC SensorThings API part 1: Sensing.
