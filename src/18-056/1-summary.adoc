== Summary

This discussion paper offers descriptions and provides JSON examples of TaskingCapabilities and Tasks for the SensorThings Application Programming Interface (API).

=== Requirements & Research Motivation

The OGC SensorThings API Part II â€“ Tasking Core (OGC 17-079r1) describes the standard and offers the compliance tests specifications. However, more descriptions and examples are needed in order to help users to explore what the SensorThings API (STA) Tasking can do. This discussion paper provides the needed JSON examples for different types of actuators.

=== Recommendations for Future Work

This discussion paper is intended to provide recommendations on creating TaskingCapabilities and Tasks in SensorThings. Thus, the recommendations on future work can be found at the end of each section.
